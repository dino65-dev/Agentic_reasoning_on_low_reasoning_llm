## 🔧 USAGE

### Basic Usage (Backward Compatible)

```python
from reasoning_engine import ReasoningEngine

# Create engine (automatically uses advanced version if available)
engine = ReasoningEngine(tools=['calculator', 'symbolic', 'llm'])

# Run reasoning
problem = "Tom has 3 boxes. He adds 2 items to each. Then removes 1 from box 1."
options = ["Box 1 has 4 items", "Box 2 has 5 items", "Box 3 has 5 items"]

traces, verdicts = engine.reason_over_options(problem, options)

# Results
for i, (trace, verdict) in enumerate(zip(traces, verdicts)):
    print(f"Option {i+1}: {'✅ CORRECT' if verdict else '❌ INCORRECT'}")
    print(trace)
```

### Advanced Usage (Full Features)

```python
from reasoning_engine_v2 import QuantumEnhancedReasoningEngine

# Create advanced engine
engine = QuantumEnhancedReasoningEngine(
    tools=['calculator', 'symbolic', 'llm', 'analyzer'],
    max_workers=8  # Parallel workers
)

# Run reasoning (async version for maximum speed)
traces, verdicts = engine.reason_over_options(problem, options)

# Access detailed scoring
for i, verdict in enumerate(verdicts):
    print(f"Option {i+1}:")
    print(f"  Overall Score: {verdict['score']:.3f}")
    print(f"  Confidence: {verdict['confidence']:.3f}")

```

### Async Usage (Maximum Performance)

```python
import asyncio
from reasoning_engine_v2 import QuantumEnhancedReasoningEngine

async def main():
    engine = QuantumEnhancedReasoningEngine()
    
    # Process multiple problems in parallel
    problems = [problem1, problem2, problem3]
    options_list = [options1, options2, options3]
    
    tasks = [
        engine.reason_over_options_async(p, o) 
        for p, o in zip(problems, options_list)
    ]

## 🎯 FIXES APPLIED

### Import Errors Resolved ✅

2. ✅ `from notepad_manager import NotepadManager` → Fixed to `from notepad_manager.notepad_manager import NotepadManager`
3. ✅ `problem_restatement.manual_restate_problem()` → Now uses `AdvancedProblemRestater.manual_restate_problem()`
4. ✅ `tool_invoker.select_tool()` → Implemented internal `_select_tool_simple()` method

## 🚦 MIGRATION GUIDE

### If Using Old Code:

**Before:**
```python
from reasoning_engine import ReasoningEngine
engine = ReasoningEngine(['calc', 'llm'])
traces, verdicts = engine.reason_over_options(problem, options)
```

**After (No Changes Required!):**
```python
# Exact same code works, but now automatically uses advanced engine!
from reasoning_engine import ReasoningEngine
engine = ReasoningEngine(['calc', 'llm'])
traces, verdicts = engine.reason_over_options(problem, options)
# Now with: Bayesian scoring, parallel eval, self-healing, caching!
```

### To Access Advanced Features:

```python
# Import advanced engine directly
from reasoning_engine_v2 import QuantumEnhancedReasoningEngine

engine = QuantumEnhancedReasoningEngine()
traces, verdicts = engine.reason_over_options(problem, options)

# Now `verdicts` includes detailed scoring!
for verdict in verdicts:
    print(verdict['scoring_components'])  # All 6 scoring metrics
    print(verdict['error_likelihood'])    # Predicted error rate
```

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numba'"
Optional dependency. Install: `pip install numba`

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'"
Optional dependency. Install: `pip install numpy`

### "C DLL not found"
NotepadManager will automatically fallback to subprocess method. No action needed.

### Performance seems slow
- Install optional dependencies: `pip install numpy numba`
- Increase `max_workers` parameter
- Enable C DLL for notepad manager
